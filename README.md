# FedoraControls

FedoraControls is a work-in-progress project where I'll share some of the controls I've made for Windows apps.

The current list of controls is:
- SwipeActionItem

The SwipeActionItem works much like the swipe functionality in the Outlook app. You can specify the content and description of the left and right actions, and choose the animation type for each side.
